The D-Lab is currently offering limited support for instructors on the
BerkeleyX platform.

The best way to get support for BerkelyX is to use the GitHub issue tracker.
**You can submit a new request at [this
link](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/BerkeleyX-support/issues/new).**

You'll have to make a GitHub account (you'll be prompted to sign in, and if
you don't have an account, you can make one using the "Sign up" button on the
upper right).

Once you've submitted your issue, you'll continue to get updates via email,
unless you disable this functionality. Feel free to ask for help with GitHub
as part of your request!
